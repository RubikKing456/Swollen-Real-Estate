            <h3>1980s</h3>
            <p>The 1980s marked the early stages of the UAE's real estate development. 
                The country focused on establishing critical infrastructure, and most 
                developments were government-led projects to support a growing population 
                and economy driven by oil revenues. Private real estate investment was 
                limited, and statistics on property prices or sales were minimal due to 
                the underdeveloped market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right-column">
            <h3>Key Stats and Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Population growth: The UAE's population grew from approximately 1 million 
                    in 1980 to 1.8 million in 1989, which increased demand for housing and 
                    infrastructure.</li>
                <li>GDP growth: The UAE's GDP rose significantly, from around $29 billion in 
                    1980 to nearly $40 billion by the end of the decade, fueling government-funded 
                    construction projects.</li>
                <li>Key developments: Abu Dhabi Corniche and the initial phases of Dubai's commercial 
                    district along Sheikh Zayed Road.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1990s</h3>
            <p>The 1990s saw rapid urban development, with Dubai positioning itself as a regional trade 
                and tourism hub. Although foreigners were not yet allowed to own property, there was an 
                increase in commercial real estate to support the growing business and hospitality sectors. 
                The Dubai government began experimenting with luxury and landmark developments to attract 
                tourism, which gradually spurred demand in the real estate market.</p>

            <h3>Key Stats and Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tourism: Tourist arrivals in Dubai grew from roughly 500,000 in 1990 to over 2.8 million 
                    in 1999, leading to higher demand for hotel developments.</li>
                <li>Key projects: Construction of the Burj Al Arab (completed in 1999) and initial planning 
                    for mega-developments like Jumeirah Beach Residence.</li>
                <li>Market growth: Commercial property value in Dubai increased by around 50% during the decade, 
                    as trade and tourism infrastructure expanded.</li>

            <h3>2000s</h3>
            <p>The 2000s marked a transformative period, especially with the introduction of freehold property 
                laws in Dubai in 2002, allowing foreigners to own properties in designated areas. This policy 
                shift sparked a massive property boom, as investors from around the world poured capital into Dubai. 
                The decade saw the launch of iconic projects like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Marina, and Burj Khalifa. 
                However, the global financial crisis in 2008 led to a significant downturn, with property prices 
                falling sharply.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right-column">
            <h3>Key Stats and Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Price surge: Between 2003 and 2008, property prices in Dubai rose by more than 300%, driven by 
                    foreign investment and ambitious projects.</li>
                <li>Price drop: By the end of 2009, real estate prices in Dubai had dropped by up to 50% from their 
                    2008 peak due to the financial crisis.</li>
                <li>Population growth: Dubai's population increased from approximately 800,000 in 2000 to 1.8 million 
                    by 2009, driving residential demand.</li>
                <li>Iconic developments: Palm Jumeirah (2006), Dubai Marina (2003), Burj Khalifa (2009).</li>
                <li>Property transactions: By 2008, real estate transactions in Dubai reached $71 billion before 
                    plummeting post-crisis.</li>

            <h3>2010s</h3>
            <p>The 2010s were marked by recovery and stabilization. Following the downturn, developers shifted focus 
                to affordable housing and sustainable urban planning. The announcement of Expo 2020 in 2013 boosted 
                market sentiment, and Dubai experienced a rebound in property demand. However, oversupply issues emerged 
                toward the middle of the decade, which caused a gradual decline in property prices and a push for regulatory 
                reforms to stabilize the market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right-column">
            <h3>Key Stats and Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recovery growth: Property prices in Dubai increased by about 25% from 2012 to 2014 following Expo 2020's announcement.</li>
                <li>Price correction: From 2015 to 2019, Dubai property prices declined by around 30% due to oversupply and global economic pressures.</li>
                <li>Residential transaction volumes: Dubai saw a record number of residential transactions in 2013, with over 64,000 units sold, although this 
                    slowed by the end of the decade.</li>
                <li>Population growth: Dubai's population increased to approximately 3.3 million by 2019, supporting steady demand for housing.</li>
                <li>Key reforms: Long-term visas introduced in 2019 for property investors, retirees, and skilled professionals to stimulate demand</li>

            <h3>2020s</h3>
            <p>The 2020s started with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially caused a slowdown in the real estate market. However, the UAE's 
                swift response, including economic stimulus measures and residency reforms, enabled the market to recover quickly. Expo 2020, which was 
                postponed to 2021-2022, also helped attract global attention and investment. The decade has seen increased demand for villas and luxury 
                properties as work-from-home trends shifted preferences. Additionally, government initiatives, like the introduction of long-term residency visas, 
                continue to support growth in the real estate market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right-column">
            <h3>Key Stats and Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Price recovery: In 2021, property prices in Dubai rose by approximately 20%, with a notable demand for villas and high-end properties.</li>
                <li>Expo 2020 impact: The event attracted over 24 million visitors, spurring real estate demand in 2021 and 2022.</li>
                <li>Population: Dubai's population crossed 3.5 million by 2023, increasing demand for housing, especially in suburban and villa communities.</li>
                <li>Key government initiatives: Introduction of a "Golden Visa" for investors and skilled professionals, and a rise in high-net-worth individuals moving to the UAE.</li>
